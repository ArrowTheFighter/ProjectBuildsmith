  <Text>k__BackingField: Well I drew my trusty blade from its scabbard, the Silver
    Crescent, and I charged the beast belting out a war cry like no other! We fought
    for a mighty 6 hours, sword clashing against claws. When it seemed like there
    was no hope, and the monster raised it's arm, ready to finish me off, I spotted
    a small weak spot on his chest.
