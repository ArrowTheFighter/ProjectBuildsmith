All item IDs will be singular and lower case, and the most simple way to describe the item. For example, gold coin -> coin, wood log -> wood, stone chunk ->stone

Items that require prefixes will have the prefix then an underscore and then the name. For example, iron nails would be iron_nail or a wooden beam would be wood_beam

Some items may need to be reworked if we add more variants of that item. For example, more gem colors might require the gem item to be gem_red, gem_blue, etc…
